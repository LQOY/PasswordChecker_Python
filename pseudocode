# Create an empty list to store data from log file:
# error_list = []

# Read the errors from log file and add into the error_list:
# Use open() function to open the log file for reading: open("ITWorks_password_log.txt", "r")
# Use for loop to add items from log file into the error_list
# close the log file

# Use the list to output each line:
# for loop to print each item error_list

# if ' < 6' found in item, count_pw_too_small += 1
# Count the number of passwords above the maximum length:
# if  ' > 10' found in item, count_pw_too_large += 1
